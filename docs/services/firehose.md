## How it works

1. **Buffering**: Incoming records are buffered in memory.
2. **Automatic Flush**: A buffer is delivered to S3 when either trigger of the stream's `BufferingHints` fires first, mirroring AWS's buffered delivery:
    - the buffered records reach `SizeInMBs` (default 5 MiB), or
    - `IntervalInSeconds` (default 300 s) has elapsed since the first buffered record. A background flusher checks this every `floci.services.firehose.tick-interval-seconds` (default 10 s).

    An emulator-only record-count trigger is also available for local dev: set `floci.services.firehose.flush-record-count` (env: `FLOCI_SERVICES_FIREHOSE_FLUSH_RECORD_COUNT`) to flush after that many buffered records — `1` gives LocalStack-style record-at-a-time delivery. Disabled by default (`0`) so delivery timing matches real AWS.

    Buffers are also flushed on shutdown, so pending records are not lost. Deleting a delivery stream discards its pending records without flushing, matching real AWS.
3. **Format**: Buffered records are concatenated as bytes and delivered to the bucket configured in the S3 destination (`floci-firehose-results` if the stream has no destination configuration). The object is then compressed according to the destination's `CompressionFormat` and always stored with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`, as AWS does.

    Known deviations from AWS in the delivery path:

    - **Record separator.** Floci appends a newline after any record that does not already end with one, so the delivered object is newline-delimited. Real AWS concatenates the record bytes verbatim and inserts no separator — three records of `abc` are delivered as the 9 bytes `abcabcabc`, not as 12 bytes with separators. Producers that rely on the delimiter therefore work against Floci and not against AWS, which is why AWS's own guidance is to put the delimiter inside the record.
    - **Optional destination.** Floci accepts a delivery stream with no destination configuration at all, and one whose destination omits `BucketARN` or `RoleARN`; with no destination it delivers to `floci-firehose-results`. AWS requires exactly one complete destination: it answers `InvalidArgumentException` ("Exactly one destination configuration is supported for a Firehose") when none is given, and `ValidationException` ("Member must not be null") for a destination missing `bucketARN` or `roleARN`. The default bucket is a local-development convenience with no AWS equivalent.

## Compression

`CompressionFormat` is applied to the delivered object, adding the key extension and `Content-Encoding` AWS pairs with each format:

| `CompressionFormat` | Key extension | `Content-Encoding` | Container format |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UNCOMPRESSED` | *(none)* | *(none)* | the records as they were put |
| `GZIP` | `.gz` | `gzip` | gzip stream |
| `ZIP` | `.zip` | `zip` | zip archive holding a single deflated entry named with a UUID |
| `Snappy` | `.snappy` | `snappy-java` | the [xerial snappy-java stream format](https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java#compatibility-notes) (magic `0x82 "SNAPPY" 0x00`), **not** the [official Snappy framing format](https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/main/framing_format.txt) |
| `HADOOP_SNAPPY` | `.snappy` | `hadoop-snappy` | Hadoop's block framing, what Hadoop and Spark `SnappyCodec` consumers read |

The two Snappy variants share an extension and are told apart only by `Content-Encoding`; they are mutually unreadable, so a consumer must pick the matching decoder. Note that AWS's [object name documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/s3-object-name.html) tables `.hsnappy` for Hadoop-Snappy, but the service delivers `.snappy`; Floci follows the service.

Any other value, including differently-cased ones such as `SNAPPY` instead of `Snappy`, is rejected with `ValidationException`.

## S3 object keys

Delivered objects are named `<evaluated prefix><streamName>-<versionId>-<yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss>-<uuid><file extension>`, matching [AWS's object name format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/s3-object-name.html):

- Without a `Prefix`, the default prefix `yyyy/MM/dd/HH/` is used.
- A `Prefix` without expressions gets `yyyy/MM/dd/HH/` appended by literal concatenation — no `/` is inserted, exactly like AWS (`legacy` → `legacy2026/07/13/14/...`).
- [Custom prefix expressions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/s3-prefixes.html) are evaluated: `!{timestamp:<pattern>}` (Java `DateTimeFormatter` pattern; all instances share the same instant) and `!{firehose:random-string}` (a fresh 11-character alphanumeric string per instance). When the prefix contains any expression, nothing is appended to it.
- `CustomTimeZone` is honored for all timestamps; absent or invalid time zones fall back to UTC.
- `<file extension>` comes from the `CompressionFormat` table above, unless the destination sets `FileExtension`, which **replaces** it rather than being appended to it (`GZIP` plus `FileExtension: .custom.log` yields a key ending in `.custom.log`, with a gzip body and `Content-Encoding: gzip` regardless). The empty string means "not specified" and brings the compression extension back. `FileExtension` must match `^(|\.[0-9a-z!\-_.*'()]+)$` and be at most 128 characters, or the request is rejected with `ValidationException`.

Known deviations from AWS: timestamps are evaluated at flush time instead of the oldest buffered record's arrival time; expressions AWS would reject at create time (unknown namespaces, `!{partitionKeyFromQuery:...}`/`!{partitionKeyFromLambda:...}` dynamic partitioning keys, invalid patterns) are kept literally in the key; `FileExtension` is accepted on the legacy `S3DestinationConfiguration` shape too, where AWS only defines it on the extended one.
