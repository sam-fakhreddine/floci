# Route53

Route53 emulation supporting hosted zones, resource record sets, health checks, change tracking, and tagging. Private hosted zones provide embedded DNS resolution for cluster containers such as EKS and workloads wired to Floci's embedded DNS server.

## Supported Operations

<!-- floci:actions:start -->
| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `CreateHostedZone` | `POST /2013-04-01/hostedzone`. A `<VPC>` element in the request creates a private zone and records the first VPC association. |
| `GetHostedZone` | `GET /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}`. Private zones include their `<VPCs>` list. |
| `UpdateHostedZoneComment` | `POST /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}` |
| `DeleteHostedZone` | `DELETE /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}` |
| `ListHostedZones` | `GET /2013-04-01/hostedzone` |
| `ListHostedZonesByName` | `GET /2013-04-01/hostedzonesbyname` |
| `AssociateVPCWithHostedZone` | `POST /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}/associatevpc`. Private zones only; cross-account associations require prior authorization. |
| `DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone` | `POST /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}/disassociatevpc`. Refuses to remove the last association (`LastVPCAssociation`). |
| `CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization` | `POST /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}/authorizevpcassociation`. Must be called by the hosted-zone owner. |
| `DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization` | `POST /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}/deauthorizevpcassociation`. Must be called by the hosted-zone owner; success has an empty response body. |
| `ListVPCAssociationAuthorizations` | `GET /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}/authorizevpcassociation`. Paginates with `maxresults` / `nexttoken`. |
| `ListHostedZonesByVPC` | `GET /2013-04-01/hostedzonesbyvpc?vpcid=…&vpcregion=…`. Paginates with `maxitems` / `nexttoken`. |
| `GetHostedZoneCount` | `GET /2013-04-01/hostedzonecount` |
| `ChangeResourceRecordSets` | `POST /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}/rrset` |
| `ListResourceRecordSets` | `GET /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}/rrset` |

| `ChangeTagsForResource` | `POST /2013-04-01/tags/{ResourceType}/{ResourceId}` |
| `GetAccountLimit` | `GET /2013-04-01/accountlimit/{Type}` |
| `GetHealthCheckStatus` | `GET /2013-04-01/healthcheck/{HealthCheckId}/status` |
| `GetDNSSEC` | `GET /2013-04-01/hostedzone/{Id}/dnssec`. Always reports signing as `NOT_SIGNING`. |
| `GetHostedZoneLimit` | `GET /2013-04-01/hostedzonelimit/{HostedZoneId}/{Type}` |

## Behavior

- All changes return status `INSYNC` immediately (no async propagation simulation).
- Every new hosted zone automatically gets SOA and NS records at the zone apex. These records cannot be deleted.
- `DeleteHostedZone` fails with `HostedZoneNotEmpty` if the zone contains records other than the apex SOA and NS.
- `ChangeResourceRecordSets` validates all changes atomically before applying any.
- Supported change actions: `CREATE`, `UPSERT`, `DELETE`.
- Hosted zone IDs are returned with the `/hostedzone/` prefix in XML responses (e.g. `/hostedzone/Z1PA6795UKMFR9`). The AWS SDK strips this prefix client-side.
- Health check IDs are plain UUIDs without a prefix.
- Tags are supported for both `hostedzone` and `healthcheck` resource types.
- A hosted zone is private when `CreateHostedZone` carries a `<VPC>` element; `HostedZoneConfig.PrivateZone` is response-only.
- `AssociateVPCWithHostedZone` rejects public zones with `PublicZoneVPCAssociation`, and `DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone` rejects removing the last VPC with `LastVPCAssociation`.
- Associating a VPC that is already attached to another zone with the same name fails with `ConflictingDomainExists`.
- Cross-account association follows the Route 53 authorization lifecycle: the hosted-zone owner authorizes the VPC, the VPC account associates it, and the hosted-zone owner can then delete the authorization without removing the association.
- A cross-account association without a matching authorization fails with `NotAuthorizedException`.
- Private hosted zones support up to 300 VPC associations and up to 1000 outstanding cross-account VPC association authorizations, matching the documented Route 53 default quotas.
- Set `FLOCI_SERVICES_ROUTE53_VPC_ASSOCIATION_CONTROL_PLANE_DELAY_MS` above `0` to emulate a short in-flight control-plane window for retry testing. During that window, a subsequent `AssociateVPCWithHostedZone` for the same hosted zone returns `PriorRequestNotComplete`; overlapping create/delete authorization requests return `ConcurrentModification`. These are the retryable overlap errors documented by Route 53 for those operations.

## Private Hosted Zone DNS Resolution

Floci resolves private hosted zone DNS records directly through its embedded DNS server on port 53. Cluster containers (such as EKS k3s containers) and workloads wired to embedded DNS automatically query Floci as their primary resolver.

- **Record Types**: Resolves IPv4 `A` records (including `CNAME` and `ALIAS` target chasing across private zones, EC2 internal names, and external hostnames). When a private CNAME targets a public hostname, Floci resolves the target addresses off the event loop so container stub resolvers succeed. Multiple values are returned as separate answers.
- **TTL and Negative Answers**: Answers carry the record set's `TTL`. A chased `CNAME` chain is flattened to `A` records, so it answers with the shortest TTL in the chain; an alias answers with its target's TTL, and an alias or `CNAME` to a name outside the private zones answers with at most 60 seconds, since Floci cannot see that target's TTL. A name absent from the zone receives NXDOMAIN; a name that exists without an `A` record (only `TXT`, for example, or only records beneath it) receives NOERROR with no answers. A wildcard record such as `*.example.internal` answers only when neither the name nor an ancestor closer than the wildcard exists, so a record at `api.team.example.internal` keeps the wildcard from answering for `team.example.internal` or anything beneath it.
- **Zone Visibility and Fallthrough**: Only private hosted zones (created with a VPC association) are answered by Floci's embedded Route 53 resolver. Public zones and external domains fall through to upstream forwarders. Because the standard DNS wire protocol carries no caller VPC identifier, Floci resolves across private zones without filtering by account or VPC ID.
- **Resolver Rule Precedence**: A Route 53 Resolver rule associated with the querying container's VPC takes precedence over a private hosted zone that matches the same name, as it does in AWS: the query is forwarded to the rule's targets instead of answered from the zone. See [Route 53 Resolver](route53resolver.md#resolver-rules-and-dns-resolution).
- **Zero-Restart Propagation**: Record changes via `ChangeResourceRecordSets` take effect immediately without restarts.
- **Kubernetes and external-dns Compatibility**: In-cluster controllers like `external-dns` provisioning Route 53 private records for Services or Ingresses are immediately resolvable.

## Default Nameservers

New zones use these nameservers (configurable via `floci.services.route53.*`):

```
ns-1.awsdns-01.org
ns-2.awsdns-02.net
ns-3.awsdns-03.com
ns-4.awsdns-04.co.uk
```
