# Best-effort background prefetch of the Docker images this shard's tests use.
# Never fails the build; a pull that loses the race just means the test pulls
# it itself, exactly as before. Pulls only images implied by shard.txt so four
# shards do not each pull all images (registry rate-limit exposure).
# ECR Public counts anonymous transfer per runner IP, so an image is keyed on the classes that
# start it whenever its package is spread over every shard (Lambda, ECS), and a key that names a
# class is checked against src/test/java so a rename cannot silently turn the prefetch off. The
# Docker library images the tests start come from Docker Hub, which GitHub-hosted runners pull
# without a limit; TestImages says why they are not taken through the ECR Public mirror.
# Each pull writes one line to $PREFETCH_LOG (prefetch-images.log next to shard.txt by default):
# "prefetched <image>" or "prefetch failed <image>: <last line of docker's output>", timestamped,
# so a test that pulled the image itself can be told apart from a prefetch that failed or was
# still downloading. The lines go to a file because the pulls outlive the workflow step that
# started them and the step's stdout is closed by then.
# Usage: prefetch-images.sh <shard.txt>
